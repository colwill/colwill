### Hi 👋

My name is Aaron. I'm a tech lead at Mythical with over a decade of professional experience, I've used a variety of technologies and languages throughout my career, but I'm most keen on C#, Rust and NodeJS. In my spare time I work on my hobby project called `runcfg`; a runtime configuration tool.

    👷‍♂️ I’m currently working at Mythical solving for high-scalability application streaming
    🔧 I work in C#, .NET, Go, Rust, NodeJS
    🧰 I work with AWS, GCP, Rider, GoLand, CLion, Kubernetes, Docker, CodeFresh, Artifactory
    🏅 I’m interested in e-sports, running, woodworking and metalworking
    💬 I'm happy when learning something new; currently I'm learning Spanish & "Hobbyist" Silicon Design
    ✨ When not learning Spanish or Silicon design I'm building a hobby project called runcfg
