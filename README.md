### Hi 👋 I'm Az

I'm a senior leader with over a decade of professional experience in software engineering, cloud architecture and highly-scalable hybrid-cloud. I've used a variety of technologies and languages throughout my career, but I'm most keen on Rust, C#, Go and NodeJS. In my spare time I work on my hobby project [runcfg](https://github.com/runcfg); a runtime configuration tool.

    👷‍♂️ Currently working at Bazaarvoice solving for high-scalability cloud services
    🔧 I work in C#, Go, Rust, NodeJS & Python
    🧰 I work with AWS, GCP, Azure, Terraform, Ansible, Crossplane, Kubernetes, Docker, CodeFresh, Artifactory
    🏅 Interested in e-sports, running, woodworking and metalworking
    💬 I'm happy when learning something new; currently I'm learning Spanish & "Hobbyist" Silicon Design
    ✨ When not learning Spanish or Silicon design I'm building my hobby project: @runcfg
    🏃‍♂️‍➡️ Run goal this year is a half-marathon with my toddler on my shoulders ❤️

So far I've worked in the following domains throughout my career

    - Cloud Agnostic Control Planes (pre-cursor solutions to crossplane.io) for AWS, GCP, Azure
    - Platform Engineering tooling, processes, team topologies and products
    - High-throughput (+1mtps) financial payment pipelines
    - Virtual reality remote working solutions
    - Aerospace software that flies around the world every day
