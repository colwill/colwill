### Hi 👋 I'm Az

I'm a Senior Engineering Leader with two decades of experience in software engineering, a decade in cloud architecture and highly-scalable hybrid-cloud. I've used a variety of technologies and languages throughout my career, but I'm most keen on Rust, C#, Go and NodeJS. In my spare time I work on my hobby project [runcfg](https://github.com/runcfg); a runtime configuration tool for infrastructure, services and apps.

    👷‍♂️ Currently working at Akamai, creating the next hyperscaler
    🔧 I work in Go, Rust, C# NodeJS & Python
    🧰 I work with Kubernetes, Envoy, Cilium, Crossplane, AWS, GCP, Azure, Terraform, Ansible, Docker & Artifactory
    🏅 Interested in e-sports, running, woodworking and metalworking
    💬 I'm happy when learning something new; currently I'm learning Irish, Spanish & "Hobbyist" Silicon Design
    ✨ When not learning Spanish or Silicon design I'm building my hobby project: @runcfg
    🏃‍♂️‍➡️ Run goal this year is to run a marathon for cancer research

So far I've worked in the following domains throughout my career

    - Cloud Agnostic Control Planes (pre-cursor solutions to crossplane.io) for AWS, GCP, Azure
    - High-throughput (+1mrps) distributed services
    - Platform Engineering tooling, processes, team topologies and products
    - High-throughput (+1mtps) financial payment pipelines
    - Virtual reality remote working solutions
    - Aerospace software that flies around the world every day
